## Where are the login and logout API routes defined?

Unlike the [next-firebase-auth](https://github.com/gladly-team/next-firebase-auth?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started) library, `next-firebase-auth-edge` does not require you to manually define your own `/api/login` or `/api/logout` routes. These routes are automatically handled by the [authMiddleware](/docs/getting-started/middleware). For more details, check out this [explanation](https://github.com/awinogrodzki/next-firebase-auth-edge/issues/34#issuecomment-1588032612).
