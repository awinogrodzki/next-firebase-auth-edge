# Usage in Google Cloud Run Environment

Before running `next-firebase-auth-edge` in a Google Cloud Run environment, make sure to:

1. [Enable the IAM Service Account Credentials API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/iamcredentials.googleapis.com).
2. Assign the `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` permission to the IAM role attached to the [default compute service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam).

Once this is done, you can omit the `serviceAccount` option in `authMiddleware`, `getTokens`, and other functions. If `serviceAccount` is `undefined`, `next-firebase-auth-edge` will automatically extract credentials from the authenticated [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) environment.

Keep in mind that you still need to provide the Firebase `apiKey`.

Example [authMiddleware](/docs/usage/middleware) usage:

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { authMiddleware } from "next-firebase-auth-edge";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return authMiddleware(request, {
    loginPath: "/api/login",
    logoutPath: "/api/logout",
    apiKey: "XXxxXxXXXxXxxxxx_XxxxXxxxxxXxxxXXXxxXxX",
    cookieName: "AuthToken",
    cookieSignatureKeys: ["Key-Should-Be-at-least-32-bytes-in-length"],
    cookieSerializeOptions: {
      path: "/",
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: false,
      sameSite: "lax" as const,
      maxAge: 12 * 60 * 60 * 24,
    },
  });
}
```

Example [getTokens](/docs/usage/server-components) usage:

```tsx
import { getTokens } from "next-firebase-auth-edge";

const tokens = await getTokens(context.req.cookies, {
    apiKey: 'XXxxXxXXXxXxxxxx_XxxxXxxxxxXxxxXXXxxXxX',
    cookieName: 'AuthToken',
    cookieSignatureKeys: ['Key-Should-Be-at-least-32-bytes-in-length'],
});
```
