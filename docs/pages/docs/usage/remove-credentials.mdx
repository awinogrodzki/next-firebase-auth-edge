# Removing credentials

`next-firebase-auth-edge` provides `removeCookies` method that allows to remove authenticated cookies from inside Middleware. This can help with scenarios where we want to logout user from the app explicitly.

## Removing credentials in Middleware

Use `removeCookies` from `next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies` in order to attach expired `Set-Cookie` headers on the provided response. Those headers will cause browser to remove authenticated cookies.

```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { removeCookies } from "next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies";

//...
function forceLogout(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));

  removeCookies(response);

  return response;
}
```
