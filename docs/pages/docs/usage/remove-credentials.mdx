# Removing Credentials

The `next-firebase-auth-edge` library provides a `removeCookies` method to remove authenticated cookies within Middleware. This is useful for situations where you want to explicitly log a user out of the app.

## Removing Credentials in Middleware

To remove authenticated cookies, use the `removeCookies` function from `next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies`. This will attach expired `Set-Cookie` headers to the response, prompting the browser to delete the authenticated cookies.

```tsx
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { removeCookies } from "next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies";

//...
function forceLogout(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));

  removeCookies(response);

  return response;
}
```
