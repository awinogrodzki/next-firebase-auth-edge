# Removing Credentials

The `next-firebase-auth-edge` library provides a `removeCookies` method to remove authenticated cookies within Middleware. This is useful for situations where you want to explicitly log a user out of the app.

## Removing Credentials in Middleware or API routes

To remove authenticated cookies in Middleware or API routes, use the `removeCookies` function from `next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies`. This will attach expired `Set-Cookie` headers to the response, prompting the browser to delete the authenticated cookies.

```tsx
import {NextRequest, NextResponse} from 'next/server';
import {removeCookies} from 'next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies';

//...
function forceLogout(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url));

  removeCookies(request.headers, response, {
    cookieName: 'AuthToken',
    cookieSerializeOptions: {
      path: '/',
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: false,
      sameSite: 'lax' as const,
      maxAge: 12 * 60 * 60 * 24
    }
  });

  return response;
}
```

## Removing Credentials in Server Actions

To remove authenticated cookies in Server Actions, use the `removeServerCookies` function from `next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies`. This will remove authentication cookies using `cookies.delete` method on Next.js cookies object

```tsx
import {NextRequest, NextResponse} from 'next/server';
import {cookies} from 'next/headers';
import {removeServerCookies} from 'next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/next/cookies';

// Since Next.js 15, `cookies` and `headers` functions returns a Promise, so we need to precede them with `await`.
removeServerCookies(await cookies(), {
  cookieName: 'AuthToken',
});
```
