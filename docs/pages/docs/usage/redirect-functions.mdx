# Redirect Helper Functions

The library offers a set of helper functions designed to handle common redirect scenarios.

These redirect functions simplify the process of creating a [redirect response in Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware).

Below is an example of the `redirectToPath` helper function included in the library:

```ts
export function redirectToPath(
  request: NextRequest,
  path: string,
  options: RedirectToPathOptions = {shouldClearSearchParams: false}
) {
  const url = request.nextUrl.clone();
  url.pathname = path;

  if (options.shouldClearSearchParams) {
    url.search = '';
  }

  return NextResponse.redirect(url);
}
```

As shown, itâ€™s a simple function that structures the NextResponse object for redirects.

Keep in mind, **you are not required to use the library's redirect functions.** You can easily implement your own redirect logic if needed.

## redirectToPath

Example usage

```ts
import {redirectToPath} from 'next-firebase-auth-edge';
```

```ts
redirectToPath(request, '/dashboard', {shouldClearSearchParams: true});
```

## redirectToHome

`redirectToHome` is a simplified version of `redirectToPath` function. It redirects user to `/` page.

```ts
import {redirectToHome} from 'next-firebase-auth-edge';
```

```ts
redirectToHome(request);
```

## redirectToLogin

`redirectToLogin` is used to redirect unauthenticated users to a public authentication page. It also skips redirect in case a request matches on of provided `publicPaths`.

```ts
import {redirectToLogin} from 'next-firebase-auth-edge';
```

```ts
redirectToLogin(request, {
  path: '/sign-in',
  publicPaths: ['/sign-in', '/register', /^\/post\/(\w+)/]
});
```
