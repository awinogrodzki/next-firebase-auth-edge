# AuthContext

The library doesn't include any client-side code or built-in authentication state context. It's up to the developer to decide how to manage user data throughout the application.

Check out the example of an `AuthContext` below:

## Example AuthContext

The following is an example implementation of custom `AuthContext` using React's [createContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext).

```tsx filename="AuthContext.ts"
import {createContext, useContext} from 'react';
import {UserInfo} from 'firebase/auth';
import {Claims} from 'next-firebase-auth-edge/lib/auth/claims';

export interface User extends UserInfo {
  emailVerified: boolean;
  customClaims: Claims;
}

export interface AuthContextValue {
  user: User | null;
}

export const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextValue>({
  user: null
});

export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```
