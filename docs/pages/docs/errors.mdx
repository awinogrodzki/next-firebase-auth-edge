# Handling Errors

## handleInvalidToken

The [Auth middleware](/docs/usage/middleware) provides a `handleInvalidToken` function, which is called with an `InvalidTokenReason` as the first argument.

The `InvalidTokenReason` is primarily for informational purposes. The `handleInvalidToken` function is typically called when something **expected** happens, allowing the user to be safely redirected to the login page. One common **expected** event is when a user visits your app for the first time.

### InvalidTokenReason

The table below describes the different types of `InvalidTokenReason`:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `MISSING_CREDENTIALS` | The request does not contain an authentication cookie |
| `MISSING_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Credentials have expired, and no refresh token is available |
| `MALFORMED_CREDENTIALS` | The cookies cannot be parsed or the structure has changed |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | The cookie signature cannot be verified or the signature keys have changed |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | The cookies have a valid structure, but the `idToken` cannot be verified |
| `INVALID_KID` | This error usually means the certificate used to sign the token has expired, which is **expected**. Google periodically refreshes certificates as part of [key rotation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/key-rotation/) |

## handleError

Unlike `handleInvalidToken`, which handles **expected** issues, `handleError` is called when something **unexpected** occurs that a developer should investigate.

The `handleError` function receives an `AuthError` object as the first argument. This object includes `code` and `message` properties, which describe the type and meaning of the error.

The error codes are divided as follows:

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND` | The user cannot be found, possibly because they were removed after generating or refreshing the custom token |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIAL` | The token could not be refreshed due to an invalid refresh token or service account credentials |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Handled internally to refresh the token. Occurs when the custom `idToken` has expired |
| `USER_DISABLED` | Thrown when `authMiddleware` is called with `checkRevoked: true` and the user has been disabled |
| `TOKEN_REVOKED` | Thrown when `authMiddleware` is called with `checkRevoked: true` and the token has been revoked |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | The token has an incorrect structure or the certificate used to sign it has expired |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An internal error occurred. Check the error message for more details |
| `NO_KID_IN_HEADER` | Handled internally to verify the token against all public certificates. Re-throws `INVALID_SIGNATURE` if none of the public keys match the token's signature |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | The token signature cannot be verified |
