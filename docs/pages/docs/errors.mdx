# Handling errors

## handleInvalidToken

[Auth middleware](/docs/usage/middleware)'s `handleInvalidToken` function is called with `InvalidTokenReason` as the first argument.

The role of `InvalidTokenReason` is mostly informative. `handleInvalidToken` is usually called when something **expected** happens and we can safely redirect user to the login page. One of those **expected** events might be a user visiting your app for the first time.

### InvalidTokenReason

Following table describes different types of `InvalidTokenReason`

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `MISSING_CREDENTIALS` | Request does not contain authentication cookie |
| `MISSING_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Credentials have expired, but refresh token is not available |
| `MALFORMED_CREDENTIALS` | Cookies cannot be parsed or the structure has changed |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Cookie signature cannot be verified or cookie signature keys have changed |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Cookies have valid structure, but `idToken` cannot be verified |
| `INVALID_KID` | This error usually indicates that certificate the token has been signed with has expired. This is **expected**. Google refreshes certificates periodically, which is a form of [key rotation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/key-rotation/) |

## handleError

Contrary to [handleInvalidToken](/docs/errors#handleinvalidtoken), `handleError` is called when something **unexpected** happens. Something a developer should take a closer look at.

`handleError` is called with `AuthError` as the first argument. `AuthError` has `code` and `message` properties that describe the type and meaning of the error

It can be divided into following types

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND` | User cannot be found. Most likely was removed between generating and refreshing custom token |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIAL` | Token could not be refreshed due to invalid refresh token or service account credentials |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Handled internally to refresh the token. Happens when custom `idToken` has expired  |
| `USER_DISABLED` | Thrown when `authMiddleware` is called with `checkRevoked: true` and the user has been disabled |
| `TOKEN_REVOKED` | Thrown when `authMiddleware` is called with `checkRevoked: true` and the token has been revoked |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Token has incorrect structure or certificate this token was signed with has expired |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Internal error. Check error message for details |
| `NO_KID_IN_HEADER` | Handled internally to verify token against all public certificates. Re-throws `INVALID_SIGNATURE` if none of the public keys match token signature. |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Token signature cannot be verified |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `USER_NOT_FOUND`     | The user cannot be found, possibly because they were removed after generating or refreshing the custom token                                                 |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIAL` | The token could not be refreshed due to an invalid refresh token or service account credentials                                                              |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED`      | Handled internally to refresh the token. Occurs when the custom `idToken` has expired                                                                        |
| `USER_DISABLED`      | Thrown when `authMiddleware` is called with `checkRevoked: true` and the user has been disabled                                                              |

| `INVALID_ARGUMENT`   | The token has an incorrect structure or the certificate used to sign it has expired                                                                          |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR`     | An internal error occurred. Check the error message for more details                                                                                         |
| `NO_KID_IN_HEADER`   | Handled internally to verify the token against all public certificates. Re-throws `INVALID_SIGNATURE` if none of the public keys match the token's signature |
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE`  | The token signature cannot be verified                                                                                                                       |
